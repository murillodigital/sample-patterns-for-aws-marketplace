# Sample Pattners for AWS Marketplace

Welcome to the AWS Marketplace Sample Patterns repository! This repository contains a collection of sample pattenrs to help
you build solutions on AWS using 3rd party software. Each of the examples showcases a specific use case and is designed to
help you get started with software acquired from the AWS Marketplace.

**Disclaimer**: Sample code, software libraries, command line tools, proofs of concept, templates,
or other related technology are provided as AWS Content or Third-Party Content under the AWS Customer Agreement,
or the relevant written agreement between you and AWS (whichever applies). You should not use this AWS Content or
Third-Party Content in your production accounts, or on production or other critical data. You are responsible for testing,
securing, and optimizing the AWS Content or Third-Party Content, such as sample code, as appropriate for production grade
use based on your specific quality control practices and standards. Deploying AWS Content or Third-Party Content may incur
AWS charges for creating or using AWS chargeable resources, such as running Amazon EC2 instances or using Amazon S3 storage.
